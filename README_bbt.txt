This is a python 3.10 wrapper for the bitbrain SDK.
Make sure that you use the correct python version and that the bbt-sdk-1.6.dll file is in te path.

The bbt.py module is the main entry point of for the python bindings.
It is self documented and contains a simple example.

The python bindings has almost a one to one relation with the C SDK, so you can look for further documentation in the SDK distribution.
record_to_csv.py is another example that connects to a bluetooth device and records some data in csv files.

You can contact us at support@bitbrain.com for any issues you find.
